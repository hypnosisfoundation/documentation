# Hypnosis Litepaper

## Abstract

At Hypnosis Foundation, we develop and innovate a new decentralized smart-contract platform based on the EVM technology called Hypnosis. Our aim with Hypnosis is to launch a lightspeed, adaptive and interconnected blockchain that is ready for the web3 mass-adoption. 

## Use cases

The Hypnosis platform is intended to be used as an underlying Layer 0 blockchain that may power DeFi Services, GameFi, Metaverse, Web3.0 Services, Stablecoin economics and many more. 

## Problems

In current existing decentralized platforms we oftenly see problems such as un-affordable gasprices, centralization, non-transparent projects following rugpulls and other scams, regulatory compliance, speed, scalability, security breaches and many more. In the following section we will describe how we adress each of the most vibrant difficulties in the blockchain industry.


#### Un-affordable gasprices

#### Centralization

#### Transparency

#### Regulatory Compliance

#### Speed and Scalability

#### On-chain and Off-chain Security

#### Energy-consumption

### Comparison across the Market

## Consensi Mechanisms

### Delegated Proof-Of-Stake (dPoS)

### Istanbul Byzantinian Fault-Tolerance (IBFT)

### Proof-Of-Identity (PoI)

## What makes us different than the competitors

### Fully compatible with EVM

### Instant block-finality

### Cross-chain capable

### Side-chain capable

### dPoS algorithm

### EU-Compliant ECDSA 

### Integrated rollup engine

### PoI-Powered DID's (Decentralized Identities)

### Regulatory Compliance
